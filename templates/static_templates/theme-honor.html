		<h2>VeritasU Honor Code</h2>
		<p><strong>The VeritasU honor code is adapted from the Veritasu honor code. Your institution may have additional

honor code or student requirements to follow.</strong></p>
		<h2>Veritasu honor code pledge</h2>
		<p> Complete all mid-terms and final exams with my own work and only my own work. I will not 

submit the work of any other person.

 Maintain only one user account and not let anyone else use my username and/or password.

 Not engage in any activity that would dishonestly improve my results, or improve or hurt the results 

of others.</p>
		<p>Not post answers to problems that are being used to assess student performance.

Unless otherwise indicated by the instructor of an Veritasu course, learners on Veritasu are encouraged to:

 Collaborate with others on the lecture videos, exercises, homework and labs.

 Discuss with others general concepts and materials in each course.

 Present ideas and written work to fellow Veritasu learners or others for comment or criticism.</p>
