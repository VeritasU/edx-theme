    <h2>VeritasU privacy policy</h2>
    <p>
        VeritasU takes the privacy of its users very seriously. We've included some information below related to the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act ("COPPA"):
    </p>
    <p>
        COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. Therefore, we only collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has agreed (via the terms described in the following paragraph) to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your school, district, and/or teacher has not obtained this prior consent from your parent or guardian, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at support@VeritasU.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. You are responsible for understanding how any Publisher Software (defined and described below) that you install on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of VeritasU's Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our  Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. For more information on COPPA, please click here. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the basics of using VeritasU?</h2>
    <p>
        First, you have to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name ("VeritasU User ID"). Also, if you are a school or district, you may be permitted to register a school or district. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You can't select for your VeritasU User ID a name that you don't have the rights to use or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. In certain situations, your VeritasU User ID may be selected for you by your school or district; the same rules apply to them when they select an VeritasU User ID for you. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a school, district, or teacher, VeritasU will enable you to generate new assessment content, 'clone' from the quizzes and quiz banks of others that are public or shared with you. You may also set up classroom groups and provide access to students to sign up through them. an access code for you to use with each limited access group you administer (an "Access Code"). For example, if you wished to establish a closed group amongst yourself, as a teacher, and your 9th grade class, you would distribute the Access Code only to those members of your class that you wanted to view what was going on within that group. Everyone to whom a group administrator distributes the Access Code to will be a member of that "Limited Access Group."
    </p>
    <p>
        You represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf, as we described earlier). If you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity (for example, if you're an administrator agreeing to these Terms on behalf of your district), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity's behalf and bind them to these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        You promise to only use the Services for your personal, internal, non-commercial, educational use, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for you using the Services in a way that breaks the law.
    </p>
    <h2>Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
    <p>Your use of our Services is subject to our Acceptable Use Policy, which outlines below what you can and can't do with and on the Services.  Please be a good digital citizen at all times.

    <h2>Intellectual Property Policy</h2>
    <h3>The Content</h3>
    <p>
        The materials displayed or performed on the Services (including, but not limited to, text, graphics, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (defined below), and so forth) (the "Content") are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including VeritasU's) rights. For example, if someone shares a really creative lesson plan with you on VeritasU, that doesn't mean you can print it out and start distributing it to other people - unless the owner specifically told you in writing that you could.</p>
    <p>
        You understand that VeritasU owns the Services. You won't modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), creative derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
    <p>
        The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn't mean that all the restrictions above don't apply.</p>
    <h3>User Submissions</h3>
    <p>
        Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your "User Submission." Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>
    <p>
        For all User Submissions, you hereby grant VeritasU a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on your iPhone as well as your computer) and reproduce such User Submission, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only - your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>
    <p>
        If you store a User Submission in your own personal VeritasU account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a "Personal User Submission"), you grant VeritasU the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Personal User Submission to you and providing you the Services necessary to do so.</p>
    <p>
        If you share a User Submission only within a Limited Access Group, or otherwise in a manner that only certain specified users can view (each, a "Limited Access User Submission"), then you grant VeritasU the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Access User Submission for the sole purpose of displaying that Limited Access User Submission to other members of that Limited Access Group (or to such specified users, as applicable) and providing you the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant the other members of that Limited Access Group (or such specified users, as applicable) a license to access that Limited Access User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services. For example, if you share a worksheet (that can be completed through the Services) with students in your Limited Access Group, you grant your students the rights necessary to view that worksheet and fill it out, and return it to you.</p>
    <p>
        If you share a User Submission in a public "community" on the Services or in a manner that more than just you or your Limited Access Group can view (a "Public User Submission"), then you grant VeritasU the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of displaying that Public User Submission to all VeritasU users and providing you the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with VeritasU, provided that VeritasU will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>
    <p>
        You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, irrevocable, and worldwide, for as long as your User Submissions are stored with us. When you delete your VeritasU account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from VeritasU's records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</p>
    <p>
        Finally, you understand and agree that VeritasU, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media.</p>
    <h2>DMCA Takedown Policy</h2>
    <p>
        You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), as it relates to online service providers like VeritasU removing material that they believe in good faith violates someone's copyright. To learn more about DMCA, click here. Here is VeritasU's DMCA Takedown Policy.</p>
    <p>
        In accordance with the DMCA, VeritasU has adopted the general policy below toward copyright infringement. Remember that your use of VeritasU's Services is at all times subject to the Terms of Service, which incorporates this DMCA Takedown Policy. Any terms we use here without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Service. The address of VeritasU's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ("Designated Agent") is listed at the end of this Policy.</p>
    <p>
        VeritasU respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects you to do the same. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.</p>
    <h3>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements</h3>
    <p>
        If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>
            <li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>
            <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Edmodo is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>
            <li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;</li>
            <li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in 1(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
            <li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received</h3>
    <p>Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:
        <ol>
            <li>remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>
            <li>notify the content provider, member or user who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and</li>
            <li>terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent</h3>
    <p>
        If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider, member, or user has the right to send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
        <ol>
            <li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</li>
            <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>
            <li>A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and</li>
            <li>Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or, if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Edmodo is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, VeritasU may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that VeritasU may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at VeritasU discretion.</p>

    <h2>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h2>
    <p>
        Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. The Services may contain, or direct you to websites containing, information you may find offensive or inappropriate; we can't control that, but please let us know if it happens and we'll try to remedy the situation.</p>
    <p>
        We also can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services. But that doesn't mean we don't take security seriously; students are only permitted to access the Services within their Access Groups, we require teachers, schools, and districts guard their Access Codes with the appropriate confidentiality, as described in the Acceptable Use Policy, we enable teachers with tools for monitoring content within Access Groups, and student accounts are not enabled to "browse" groups to join.</p>
    <p>
        You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>
    <p>
        The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned, operated, or controlled by VeritasU. When you access third party websites or use third party services (including, without limitation, your use of Publisher Software, defined below), you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that VeritasU is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>
    <p>
        VeritasU has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, VeritasU will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service (including without limitation the Publisher Software). By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>
    <p>
        Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties (including without limitation Publishers). You agree that VeritasU shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
    <p>
        If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that VeritasU is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release VeritasU, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."</p>
    <h2>VeritasU Changes</h2>
    <p>
        VeritasU is a dynamic learning tool, so the Services will change over time. We may change, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), or without any reason, and without notice.</p>
    <h2>VeritasU Pricing</h2>
    <p>
        VeritasU Services consists of both free and paid service tiers. We don't charge for signing up for a basic, individual account, and we also offer VeritasU premium features and services for a fee. Upgrading an account for premium access is solely at the discretion of the user.  If you're currently using one of the basic accounts described above, we will never "reclassify" it as premium account without your consent. Student accounts are typically free. </p>
    <h2>What if I want to stop using VeritasU?</h2>
    <p>
        You're free to do that at any time. Please refer to our Privacy Policy to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.</p>

        VeritasU is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason, including your breach of these Terms. VeritasU has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
    <p>
        Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important documents you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, or would not be in the interest of someone's safety or security to do so.

    </p>
    <p>
        Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.

    </p>
    <h3>Assignment</h3>
    <p>
        You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without VeritasU's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
    </p>
    <h3>Choice of Law; Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
        These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled in Travis County, Texas, in English, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Central District of Texas.
    </p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
    <p>
        You will be responsible for withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. 
    </p>
    <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
    <p>
        You and VeritasU agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and VeritasU, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms, and that all modifications to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties (except as otherwise provided herein). No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind VeritasU in any respect whatsoever. 
    </p>
    <h3>Modifications</h3>
    <p>
        VeritasU may, its sole discretion, choose to modify, discontinue or terminate the Service, at any time and without prior notice. VeritasU may also choose to modify the Terms. If we choose to modify the Terms, we’ll post them and give you a chance to provide feedback before they become effective except in extraordinary circumstances where we think it’s important for them to become effective as soon as they are posted in which case we’ll make that clear. Once they become effective your continued use of the Service will mean you agree to be bound by the new terms. If you don’t agree then you need to stop using the Service.
    </p>
    <h3>Notices</h3>
    <p>
        Any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be in writing and given by VeritasU (i) via email (in each case to the address that you provide); or (ii) by posting on the Site or via the Service. For notices made by e-mail or posting, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted or posted, whichever is earlier.
    </p>
    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>
        The failure of VeritasU to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of VeritasU. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
